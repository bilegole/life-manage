I want a shell to record my aty
It should be able to record my activity,together with time，state，and descripion(If I want).
It should be as concise as possible,
which means I don't need to type in extra things.
I hope the log is written in the form of:
	log_id:0000001
	aty_id:00001
	[2017-7-16][8:49]
	description:begin


I have a file called "mission",which is lead out from "goal" and "daily"
And there is also a file called activity,it is used to record the activity that I may do.
Activity is record in the following format 
kind	id	name	characteristic	description_adress
1	0001	sleep	0001.1		none
1	0002	get_up			none


kind:
1----daily activity
2----mission activity
3----emergency 
4----work

characteristic:
it is writen in a rule,
start at 0000 ,means I dont want to record the characteristic.
start at 0001,means it follows the first edition of the rule.
then,
