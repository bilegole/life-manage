I get up at about 9 am.

I think its because I didn't keep a good sleep gesture,
which must be corrected form so on.

the room(ch-zj-zs-lc-8-501-603) is very mass,
the book I use at highschool haven't been cleaned up,
so I must clean it up in several days."mission set up"

I have to be familiar with the tool"vim" and "git"
also "linux" together with "shell" is what I love."mission set up".
"failure:go to change my test key "
failure solve:mission"00003"/"00004"/"00005"/"00006"/"00007" has been created.

I have waste a lot of times.
In the afternoon ,my mother is buzy buying her cookiy.
well done.
I think spend too many time on reading  kindle is not so useful.
Maybe I should set some easy goals for myself.
